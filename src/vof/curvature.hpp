/// @brief flow — VoF rung V3 (WO-O): interface curvature from volume fractions, as the Popinet
/// (2009) height-function cascade with a PLIC-volumetric paraboloid-fit fallback.
///
/// **Container-free by contract**, exactly as `vof/plic.hpp`: every entry point takes scalars and
/// small local arrays only — no `Kokkos::View`, no grid indexing, no halo/topology types. These
/// kernels are scheduled for promotion to `peclet::core::vof` at the V4 freeze
/// (`suite/docs/VOF_PLAN.md` §11), where the structured solver, the AMR octree and the per-bubble
/// block container share ONE copy, and the promotion must be a plain file move. The view-level
/// driver that walks the block, owns the scratch fields and registers `"kappa"` lives next door in
/// `vof/curvature_field.hpp` — the same split `plic.hpp` / `colour_field.hpp` already uses.
///
/// ## The cascade
///
/// 1. **Standard height function** in the *preferred* direction (the Cartesian axis with the
///    largest |n_d| of the cell's own PLIC normal). Heights are column sums of C over `NH = 7`
///    cells — Han/Evrard/Desjardins (2024) eq. (3), the column length used throughout the
///    literature — over the 3x3 transverse patch, then the second-order finite differences of
///    their eqs. (4)-(5).
/// 2. **Mixed-direction HF**, in two forms, of which only the first ships on:
///    - **2a** the same construction in the two remaining directions, tried in order of
///      decreasing |n_d|. This is what `height_curvature()` in Basilisk's `curvature.h` does
///      (`foreach_dimension()` over the sorted normal), and it is free — the columns are the same
///      colour data read along another axis. **Measured: it fires on 0.00-0.06 % of a sphere's
///      interfacial cells**, because the direction with the largest |n_d| is by construction the
///      one most likely to close.
///    - **2b** Popinet's *generalised* height function / Basilisk's `height_curvature_fit`: a
///      paraboloid through the interface positions of whichever of the 27 columns DO close.
///      Implemented (`PtFit`) and **default OFF** — it is measurably worse than routing those
///      cells to tier 3. See `VofCurvature::useMixedHeightFit` for the numbers and the mechanism,
///      and the DEVIATION note at the bottom of this comment for its halo-imposed restriction.
/// 3. **PLIC-volumetric paraboloid fit** (the "PV" method of Jibben et al. 2015, as evaluated and
///    recommended by Han, Evrard & Desjardins, *IJMF* 174:104769 (2024), arXiv:2304.08643) on a
///    **5^3 stencil with a Wendland C2 radial weight of width d = 2.5 cells** — their measured
///    best cost/accuracy fallback, and the exact configuration their §5 dynamic tests use.
///
/// **Why curvature never touches a normal derivative.** Rung V0 measured that MYC's *normal* error
/// does not converge under refinement (order 0.83; ~28 % of mixed cells take the non-converging
/// Youngs branch) while its *reconstruction* error does (1.98) — `doc/vof_workorders.md`, WO-D
/// finding 2. Every branch here therefore takes its geometry from **column sums of C** (tiers 1-2)
/// or from the **PLIC planes' volumes** (tier 3). The MYC normal appears in exactly two roles,
/// both categorical rather than differentiated: it *orders the three candidate column directions*
/// (Basilisk does the same), and it *defines the local frame* of the paraboloid fit. Neither is
/// differenced, and an O(1 deg) error in either changes only which equally-valid representation of
/// the same interface is fitted.
///
/// ## Sign and units
///
/// Curvature is returned as **kappa = 2H** in units of 1/h (cell units; multiply by 1/h for
/// physical units), positive for a *convex blob of liquid* — a sphere of liquid of radius R cells
/// gives kappa = +2/R. `C` is the liquid fraction and the PLIC normal `m` points into the gas
/// (`plic.hpp` convention), so the two conventions are consistent by construction.
///
/// The height is a **signed** column sum (`hfColumnHeight`), and the sign is what makes one
/// formula serve both orientations: with liquid on the low side the sum equals `z_I + R + 1/2`,
/// with liquid on the high side it equals `R + 1/2 - z_I`, so in both cases `h` grows with the
/// amount of liquid — and Han's eq. (5), whose numerator is odd in h and whose denominator is even,
/// returns the same H either way. Only the *consistency* test cares about the orientation: all nine
/// columns of a patch must be oriented the same way, or the nine numbers do not describe one
/// single-valued surface. (`h` itself is the interface position along the column only up to that
/// sign: the position is `orient * h`, which is what tier 2b's point cloud needs.)
///
/// ## Two facts from the literature the callers must respect, not fight
///
/// - **A cascade that never falls back has a bug.** Han et al. measure the HF method failing for
///   ~51 % of random paraboloids with curvedness C > 1e-1, and — on the *2D stationary droplet*,
///   i.e. the friendliest possible case — still up to **0.9 % of interfacial cells at
///   D/dx = 102.4**. Below ~4-5 cells per diameter it fails everywhere.
/// - **Curvature error stops converging below C*dx ~ 1e-2 with advection-realistic volume
///   fractions**, for every published method (their §3 and §4.1, following Remmerswaal & Veldman's
///   Lemma 3: a first-order-in-Linf volume fraction field makes the curvature zeroth-order). A
///   plateau on fine grids is the method's physics; it is measured and reported, never chased.
///
/// ## DEVIATION recorded: which "mixed-direction HF" this is, and why 2b ships off
///
/// Popinet (2009) §3 and Basilisk's `curvature.h` offer two things that both get called "mixed":
/// (a) trying the three column directions in turn (`height_curvature`), and (b) a paraboloid fit
/// to the interface *positions* implied by every defined height, in any direction
/// (`height_curvature_fit`). Both are implemented here as tiers 2a and 2b.
///
/// 2b carries one restriction and one measured verdict.
/// - **Restriction.** Basilisk gathers heights over the 3^3 neighbourhood, which needs colour at
///   +/-1 +/- 3 = +/-4 cells, i.e. a g = 4 halo or a separate exchange of the three height fields.
///   This implementation gathers from the 3x3 patches of the three directions instead — cells at
///   offsets (+/-1, +/-1, +/-3) — so the WHOLE rung fits exactly inside the colour field's existing
///   g = 3 halo (tier 1 reaches 3x3x7, tier 3 reaches a 5^3 of MYC stencils = 7^3 of colour; both
///   are exactly +/-3). No new halo machinery is needed and none was added.
/// - **Verdict: 2b ON destroys the convergence of the MAX curvature error** (order 0.00 vs 1.86
///   over 16^3 -> 64^3 on the exact-fraction sphere), on the very cells tier 3 handles at second
///   order, for every Wendland width from 1.5 to 6.0 cells. The mechanism is structural — its data
///   set is the columns the height function could close, a *slope-selected* and therefore
///   asymmetric subset, whose lever-arm bias does not shrink with h. Full numbers and the
///   reasoning in `VofCurvature::useMixedHeightFit`; regenerated on every ctest run by gate G of
///   `tests/kokkos/test_vof_curvature.cpp`. Han et al. independently measure the PV fallback as
///   *better* than HF once volume fractions carry transport error — which is exactly the regime
///   the fallback fires in.
