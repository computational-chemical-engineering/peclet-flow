/// @file
/// @brief flow — VoF rung V5b (WO-S): the theta-consistent solid-band fill (static contact angle).
///
/// **Container-free** (the `plic.hpp` rule: scalars and small arrays only, no `View`, no indexing),
/// so every rule below is a pure function the device kernels in `advect_wy.hpp` call and a host
/// oracle can call verbatim. It replaces ONLY pass 1 of WO-Q's three-pass solid-band fill; passes
/// 2-3 (the mean of already-filled neighbours) and the shrinking depth budget are unchanged.
///
/// ## What the fill has to do
///
/// The MYC 3^3 stencil and the V3 height-function columns of a cell next to a wall reach INTO the
/// solid. WO-Q's neutral rule (the mean of the fluid face neighbours) continues the colour into the
/// wall with zero slope — the 90 deg limit of the Afkhami & Bussmann height-function boundary
/// condition (*IJNMF* 57:453, 2008). To impose a contact angle theta we instead write into the band
/// the fractions of the PLANE that continues the fluid-side interface into the solid at angle
/// theta. The unmodified V3 curvature cascade then returns the curvature of an interface that meets
/// the wall at theta, and the V4 balanced force does the rest — no force is added at the wall.
///
/// ## Sign conventions (all three are load-bearing; they are checked in `test_vof_wetting.cpp`)
///
/// - `n_w = grad(sdf)/|grad(sdf)|` points from the SOLID INTO the fluid (`sdf > 0` is fluid).
/// - the PLIC normal `m` points from the LIQUID INTO the gas, liquid side `m . x < alpha`
///   (`plic.hpp`).
/// - theta is measured THROUGH THE LIQUID, and at the contact line **`m . n_w = cos(theta)`**.
///   theta = 0 (complete wetting) gives `m = n_w`: the liquid side `m . x < alpha` is then the
///   SOLID side, i.e. a liquid film wets the wall and the band fills with liquid. theta = 180 gives
///   `m = -n_w` and an empty band. theta = 90 gives `m` perpendicular to the wall — the interface
///   standing on the wall, which is the neutral case.
///
/// ## The construction
///
/// For a solid band cell `s`, walk along `n_w(s)` to the first FLUID cell `f`, then
///
///  1. take the fluid-side normal `m_f` from a **fluid-only Youngs gradient**
///     (`youngsNormalFluidOnly`) — the 27-point Youngs weights restricted to cells that are not
///     solid and renormalized per half-plane. Restricting is what breaks the circularity: the
///     ordinary MYC normal of `f` reads the very band cells this fill is writing, so using it would
///     make the fill a fixed-point iteration on its own output. (Basilisk's `contact.h` breaks the
///     same loop with a second reconstruction pass; that is the WO-S fallback if the gate fails.)
///  2. keep from `m_f` only its component IN the wall, `t = m_f - (m_f . n_w) n_w`, and build
///     **`m_theta = cos(theta) n_w + sin(theta) t_hat`** — the unique unit vector in the
///     `(n_w, t_hat)` plane making angle theta with `n_w` on the same side as `m_f`. When `|t|` is
///     below `tEps` the interface is parallel to the wall and no rotation is defined, so `m_f` is
///     kept.
///  3. anchor the plane, and
///  4. `C_s` = the fraction of cell `s`'s unit cube on the liquid side of it.
///
/// ## Only the IN-WALL half of `m_f` is used, and that is deliberate
///
/// A fluid-only estimator cannot measure the WALL-NORMAL component of the interface normal: below
/// the first fluid row there is no colour to difference against, and the one-sided substitute reads
/// a saturating profile over half the distance. Measured on EXACT plane fractions next to a flat
/// wall (gate G0e): the fluid-only normal's angle to the wall is wrong by up to **23 deg** at
/// theta = 30, against 2.3 deg for the same Youngs stencil with the solid rows present. The
/// IN-WALL components are two-sided and complete, and their azimuth is accurate to **~1 deg** over
/// the same sweep. Since the whole point of the rung is to OVERWRITE the apparent angle with the
/// prescribed one, the construction above uses the azimuth (which is measured well) and discards
/// the wall-normal component (which is not). This is what makes the rung's accuracy independent of
/// the estimator defect the fill would otherwise inherit.
///
/// ## The anchor's own column is not enough (measured)
///
/// The construction as the work order states it walks from the band cell to the first fluid cell
/// ALONG `n_w` and uses that cell's interface. Where that cell is PURE phase the rule degenerates
/// to `C_s = C_f`, and that is wrong exactly where it matters: at a wetting angle the continued
/// interface reaches into the solid BEYOND the column where the contact line crosses the first
/// fluid row, so the columns just outside the contact circle have a pure-gas anchor and receive
/// nothing, while the true continuation puts liquid there. MEASURED on an equilibrium theta = 60
/// cap (D/dx = 20, wall on a cell face): the band column one cell outside the contact column reads
/// 0 where the continued plane gives 0.63 and 0.05 in the two rows below the wall, so the height
/// function reads a wall slope closer to 90 deg than to 60 — and the equilibrium contact angle of
/// the whole run comes out **5 deg biased towards 90**.
///
/// The fix, shipped: when the anchor is pure phase, average the theta-plane fractions of the
/// anchor's MIXED fluid neighbours (its 3^3 stencil, so at most one column away) evaluated in cell
/// `s`; with no mixed neighbour the pure continuation stands. Every read stays inside the halo the
/// exchange has already made owner-consistent, so the fill is still decomposition-independent.
///
/// ## The anchor: a measured deviation from the work order
///
/// WO-S anchors the plane at the contact point `c = p_f - sdf(p_f) n_w`, i.e. the fluid cell's PLIC
/// centroid projected onto the wall ALONG `n_w`. That point is on the wall but it is **not on the
/// interface plane** unless the interface is perpendicular to the wall: projecting along `n_w`
/// changes the plane's offset by `-sdf(p_f) cos(theta)`, an O(1) *shift of the interface* (up to
/// ~1 cell at theta = 30 deg) with the wrong sign — it removes liquid from the band for a wetting
/// angle. The consequence is that the fill is **not idempotent**: an interface already meeting the
/// wall at exactly theta is not reproduced, theta is not a fixed point of the scheme, and the
/// equilibrium angle is biased. Measured (gate G0a/G0b): the band fraction is off by up to
/// **0.26** at theta = 60, against 1e-15 for the shipped rule.
///
/// The shipped default is `kVofPivotVolume`: the plane with normal `m_theta` whose liquid volume in
/// cell `f` is exactly `C_f` (`plicAlpha`). It needs no pivot point at all, it is
/// volume-consistent with the cell it is anchored on, it is **exactly idempotent** (if the true
/// interface is a plane at angle theta then `plicAlpha` returns its offset exactly, so the band
/// receives the exact fractions of the continued interface — that identity is gate G0a), and it is
/// the only variant that does not read the poorly-measured wall-normal part of `m_f` at all.
/// `kVofPivotInterface` (the plane through the PLIC centroid `p_f` reconstructed from `m_f` — the
/// Afkhami-Bussmann / Basilisk `contact.h` rule), `kVofPivotWallNormal` (WO-S as written) and
/// `kVofPivotContactLine` ship as measured ablations (`set_contact_angle_pivot`).
///
/// **Known approximation, consistent with WO-Q.** `C_f` is the liquid fraction of the cell's FLUID
/// volume, but the reconstruction is done on the WHOLE unit cube (exactly as WO-Q's flux is), so in
/// a CUT anchor cell the plane is displaced by roughly `(1 - eps_f)/2` times the wall-normal
/// component of `m_theta` — 0.14 cells at theta = 60 on a half-cut cell, zero at theta = 90 and
/// zero in an uncut cell. Removing it needs the solid-clipped volume relation (Huang, JCP
/// 2025/2026), the same refinement WO-Q's flux defers.
