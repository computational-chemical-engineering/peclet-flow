/// @brief flow — VoF rung V5a (WO-Q): the cut-cell rules of the Weymouth–Yue colour transport.
///
/// **Container-free** (the `plic.hpp` rule: scalars and small arrays only, no `View`, no indexing),
/// so every rule below is a pure function that the device kernels in `advect_wy.hpp` and the solver
/// plumbing in `flow_ibm.hpp` call, and that a host oracle can call verbatim.
///
/// ## What a cut cell changes about Weymouth–Yue
///
/// `VOF_PLAN.md` §3 design rule 2: **`C` is the liquid fraction of the FLUID volume of a cell**, so
/// `C ∈ [0,1]` whatever the solid fraction is. The transported quantity is therefore `eps_i C_i`
/// (fluid volume × liquid fraction = liquid volume), and the split sweep becomes
///
///     eps_i C_i  <-  eps_i C_i + (F_{i-} - F_{i+}) + c_i ( o_{i+} a_{i+} - o_{i-} a_{i-} )
///     F_f = o_f * wyFaceFlux(a_f, ...)                                                        (1)
///
/// with `o_f` the face OPENNESS (fluid area fraction of the face, the same field `scalarBuildRhs`
/// and `divergOpen` weight with), `a_f = uf_f dt/h` the face Courant number and `c_i = H(C^n - ½)`
/// the frozen dilation indicator. Both the flux and the dilation term use the SAME `o_f a_f` per
/// face, and the projection zeroes `sum_f o_f u_f` per cell — so
///
///     d/dt sum_i eps_i C_i = (telescoping flux sum) + sum_i c_i (openness-weighted divergence) = 0
///
/// **exactly**, to the accuracy with which the projection's own `max|div(open u)|` vanishes. That
/// identity, not an accuracy statement, is what gate G2 measures.
///
/// The flux (1) uses the PLIC polyhedron reconstructed on the WHOLE unit cell (as if the cell were
/// not cut) and multiplies its slab volume by the open area. **This is an approximation** — the
/// accurate construction clips the PLIC polyhedron against the SOLID polygon as well
/// (Huang, *JCP* 2025/2026 solid-clipped flux polygons) and would put the liquid where the fluid
/// actually is inside the cell. It is *conservative* either way (one number per face, used with
/// opposite signs by the two neighbours), it is exact wherever the interface and the wall are
/// parallel or the cell is whole, and it is O(1) wrong in the *distribution* inside a cell whose
/// interface and wall cross. Recorded as the known gap; see the WO-Q findings.
///
/// ## The three rules that are NOT in the uncut scheme
///
/// 1. **Effective fluid volume.** `buildCellFraction` subsamples 4³, so its output is a multiple of
///    1/64 and a cell can read `eps == 0` while still owning an OPEN face (the face openness comes
///    from a different quadrature, `buildOpenness`). Dividing the update by such an `eps` would be a
///    division by zero on a cell that legitimately receives flux, so the scheme uses
///    `eps_eff = max(eps, kVofEpsFloor)` with `kVofEpsFloor = 1/64` — the subsampling resolution,
///    i.e. the smallest fluid volume the quadrature can resolve at all. A cell that is `eps == 0`
///    AND has six closed faces is SOLID: it is excluded from the update entirely and its colour is
///    supplied by the band fill below.
///    **Consequence for the conservation gate:** the exactly conserved functional is
///    `sum_i eps_eff_i C_i`, not `sum_i eps_i C_i` — they differ only on `eps == 0` cells with an
///    open face, where the raw sum silently drops whatever flux enters. Both are reported.
/// 2. **Boundedness.** Weymouth's proof bounds the flux volume against the CELL volume; in a cut
///    cell the volume is `eps_i` and the area is `o_f`, so the effective Courant number is
///    `o_f |a_f| / eps_i`. `vofCutCourant` is that number with a 0.1 floor on `eps`: the limiter
///    throttles for genuinely cut cells and does NOT chase slivers to dt = 0 (a sliver's own
///    boundedness is handled by the clip, which is measured).
/// 3. **The clip is a diagnostic, not a mechanism.** After each sweep C is clipped into [0,1] in
///    CUT cells only (`eps < 1`), and the liquid volume that the clip moved is accumulated. If that
///    number is not negligible the scheme is wrong and the fix is the solid-clipped flux polygon,
///    not a bigger clip.
///
/// ## The solid-band fill (the 90° / Afkhami–Bussmann limit)
///
/// The MYC 3³ stencil and the V3 height-function columns of a cell next to a wall reach INTO the
/// solid. Leaving those cells at 0 makes every wall look perfectly non-wetting; the neutral rule is
/// a **zero-slope continuation** of the colour into the wall, which is exactly the 90° contact angle
/// boundary condition of Afkhami & Bussmann (*IJNMF* 57:453, 2008) written as fractions. Three
/// passes with a SHRINKING depth budget (pass k writes solid cells at ghost depth ≤ 3−k and reads
/// only fluid cells or cells filled in an EARLIER pass) walk the value up to three cells into the
/// solid while keeping every read inside the halo the exchange has already made
/// decomposition-independent. WO-S replaces the pass-1 rule with the θ-consistent one and keeps
/// passes 2–3 and the depth budget unchanged.
