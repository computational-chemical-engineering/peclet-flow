# Scalar transport with immersed solids — append-only log

## 2026-10-02 — first study and round-2 prototypes (2-D disc, `tests/study/scalar_ibm/`)

**Round 1** (`disc_bc.py`, `robin.py`; table in `RESULTS.md`):
- Neumann, aperture FV: 2nd order with κ in storage/source; 1st order without it.
- Dirichlet: Gibou linear ghost 2nd order; mask 0.7–1; cut-cell FV with a centroid wall flux 1st.
- Robin, series-resistance FV: 1st order.

**Round 2** (`hybrid.py`; signed mean relative error of the Robin eigenvalue at ND = 128; order in
brackets):

| Bi | P (Papac: κ-FV + k A_w u_P) | H-k (centre-fluid, slivers merged, aperture faces, links) | Hf-1 (Gibou + Robin links) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (Neumann) | −6.2e-5 (2.0) | −4.2e-3 (1.0) | −4.3e-3 (1.2) |
| 0.1 | −1.1e-5 (1.4–1.8) | −3.4e-3 (1.0) | −3.2e-3 (1.1) |
| 1 | +2.5e-5 (1.5) | −2.8e-3 (1.0) | −2.6e-3 (1.1) |
| 10 | +3.4e-4 (1.7) | −8.3e-4 (1.1) | −7.0e-4 (1.1) |
| 100 | +2.2e-3 (1.5) | −2.3e-4 (1.4) | −1.3e-4 (1.5) |
| ∞ (Dirichlet) | — (degenerates to a mask) | −1.5e-4 (1.6) | −5.8e-5 (2.0) |

**Conclusions.**
- Merging slivers costs the Neumann limit; every κ > 0 cell must be its own unknown.
- Aperture-weighted fluid–fluid faces cost the Dirichlet limit in the link scheme (H-1 at Bi = ∞
  is order 1.5; full faces give 2.0).
- No symmetric compact scheme found is 2nd order at all Bi.
- Papac is the best compact Robin, but its Dirichlet limit is a mask.

## 2026-10-02 — round 3: Johansen–Colella / probe-flux FV (`jc.py`)

**Set-up.**
- Every κ > 0 cell is an unknown; κ mass; aperture two-point faces.
- Wall flux from a probe point on the wall normal, with Robin eliminated per facet:
  - D du/ds = S − β u_G;
  - u_G = D S / (k + D β);
  - flux into the cell = −k A_w u_G.

**Variants** (relative error of the Robin eigenvalue at ND = 128; order ~2.0 at every Bi unless
noted):

| variant | Bi = 0.1 | 1 | 10 | 100 | ∞ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| JC quadratic normal (2 column-intersection points) | 1.2e-5 | 2.8e-6 | 4.1e-5 | 7.1e-5 | 7.5e-5 |
| JC-lin (1 point on the next column line, 3-pt quadratic transverse) | 2.8e-5 | 7.9e-5 | 1.1e-4 | 2.1e-4 | 2.1e-4 |
| probe c = 0.7 h, bilinear (4 cells, reach 2) | 2.2e-5 | 5.6e-5 | 8.4e-6 | 3.0e-5 | 3.5e-5 |
| probe c = 1.0 h | | | | | 1.5e-4 |
| probe c = 1.5 h | | | | | 4.5e-4 |

- The quadratic-normal variant has the smallest error, but it is erratic: signs and orders jump.
- The face-centroid flux interpolation makes no difference (JC vs JC-nofc agree to 3 digits), so it
  is not needed.

**Conclusion.** The decisive ingredient is a wall gradient over a probe distance ≥ ~0.7 h,
interpolated from neighbours. It never uses the cut cell's own value over its (possibly tiny)
distance. One unknown set and one formula cover Neumann → Robin → Dirichlet at 2nd order, and the
3-D stencil is compact: 27-point plus a reach of 2.

## 2026-10-02 — round 4: conjugate probe-flux FV (`conj.py`)

**Set-up.**
- Solid core r < 0.5 (D_s, capacity g_s, partition K, contact h_c), fluid annulus, u = 0 at
  R = 1 (immersed, probe Dirichlet).
- Two fields on one grid; per facet a fluid probe and a solid probe; the 2×2 interface elimination
  (pymrm `ibm_coupling` structure, in flux form) is exactly conservative.
- Exact reference: a Bessel determinant.

Error at ND = 128:

| case | error | order |
|---|---|---|
| D_s = 10 | 1.7e-4 | 2.0 |
| D_s = 0.1 | 9.2e-6 | 3.0 |
| D_s = 100, g_s = 0.5 | 2.0e-4 | 2.0 |
| K = 3 | 8.6e-5 | 2.0 |
| h_c = 5 | 4.1e-5 | 2.1 |
| D_s = 10, K = 0.5, h_c = 2, g_s = 2 | 7.0e-7 | (~2.5 to ND = 64) |

The probe fallback (renormalized valid weights, then a longer probe) fired once per case, at
ND = 16.

## 2026-10-02 — round 5: solver fit (`solver.py`)

**Set-up.**
- A = the probe-flux operator (c = 0.7 h) on the disc.
- Systems: steady, and backward-Euler with dt·D/h² = 1 or 10.
- Preconditioner: an exact solve of a symmetric 5-point surrogate S, standing in for an ideal MG
  V-cycle.

**Lexicographic Gauss–Seidel directly on A converges.** It is as slow as GS always is on the
steady problem (residual 0.7 after 200 sweeps at ND = 128) and reaches 5e-16 at dt·D/h² = 1. So
the positive off-diagonal probe weights do NOT break GS.

**Surrogate S = aperture FV + κ + diagonal wall term A_w/(h²(d + 1/k)).**

| d in the surrogate | Bi = ∞ | Bi = 10 | Bi = 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| centroid distance (= RF) | ρ(I − S⁻¹A) = 0.995; BiCGStab 59–87 it, GMRES(20) 150–368 it | BiCGStab 3–6 | BiCGStab 2–3 |
| probe distance 0.7 h ("lumped probe": off-diagonal probe weights summed onto the diagonal) | ρ = 0.55; BiCGStab 8–9 it, GMRES(20) 15–17, mesh-independent ND 32→128 | ρ ≤ 0.27; BiCGStab 3–5 | ρ ≤ 0.05; BiCGStab 2–3 |

**Conclusion.** Use BiCGStab (or GMRES/FGMRES), preconditioned by an MG V-cycle on the SPD
lumped-probe surrogate. The surrogate is the existing aperture-weighted 7-point family plus a κ/dt
diagonal plus a diagonal wall term, so CutcellMG-style machinery applies. The probe operator itself
is applied only as a sparse cut-cell overlay matvec.
